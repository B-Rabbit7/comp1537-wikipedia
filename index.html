            <b><i>League of Legends (LoL)</i></b>, commonly referred to as <b><i>League</i></b>, is a 2009
            <span>multiplayer online battle arena video</span>
            game developed and published by <span>Riot Games</span>. Inspired by <span>Defense of the Ancients</span>, a
            <span>custom map</span> for
            <span>Warcraft III</span>, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in the same genre. Since its
            release
            in October 2009, the game has been <span>free-to-play</span> and is monetized through purchasable character
            customization. The game is available for <span>Microsoft Windows</span> and <span>macOS</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the game, two teams of five players battle in <span>player versus player </span>combat, each team
            occupying and
            defending their half of the map. Each of the ten players controls a character, known as a "champion",
            with unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, champions become more powerful by
            collecting <span>experience points</span>, earning gold, and purchasing <span>items</span> to defeat the
            opposing team. In the
            game's main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the enemy base and destroying their
            "Nexus", a large structure located within.
        </p>
        <p>
            League of Legends received generally positive reviews; critics highlighted its accessibility, character
            designs, and production value. The game's long lifespan has resulted in a critical reappraisal, with
            reviews trending positively; the negative and abusive in-game behavior of its players, criticized since
            early in the game's lifetime, persists despite Riot's attempts to fix the problem. In 2019, the game
            regularly peaked at eight million concurrent players, and its popularity has led to tie-ins such as
            music videos, comic books, short stories, and an animated series, <span>Arcane</span>. Its success has also
            spawned
            several <span>spin-off</span> video games, including a <span>mobile version</span>, a <span>digital
                collectible card game</span> and a
            <span>turn-based role-playing game</span>, among others. A <span>massively multiplayer online role-playing
                game</span> based on
            the property is in development.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regularly cited as the world's largest <span>esport</span>, the game has an international <span>competitive
                scene</span>
            consisting of 12 leagues. These domestic leagues culminate in the annual <span><i>League of Legends World
                    Championship</i></span>. The <span>2019 event </span>registered over 100 million unique viewers,
            peaking at a concurrent
            viewership of 44 million. Domestic and international events have been broadcast on
            <span>livestreaming</span>
            websites such as <span>Twitch</span>,<span>YouTube</span> ,<span>Bilibili</span> , and on <span>cable
                television</span> sports channel <span>ESPN</span>.

                <i>League of Legends</i> is a <span>multiplayer online battle arena</span> (MOBA) game in which the
                player controls a
                character ("champion") with a set of unique abilities from an <span>isometric</span> perspective. As of
                November 2021, there are 157 champions available to play. Over the course of a match, champions gain
                levels by accruing <span>experience points </span>(XP) through killing enemies. Items can be acquired to
                increase
                champions' strength, and are bought with gold, which players accrue passively over time and earn
                actively by defeating the opposing team's minions, champions, or defensive structures.In the
                main game mode, Summoner's Rift, items are purchased through a shop menu available to players only when
                their champion is in the team's base. Each match is discrete; levels and items do not transfer from
                one match to another.

                Summoner's Rift is the flagship game mode of League of Legends and the most prominent in
                <span>professional-level play</span>. The mode has a ranked competitive ladder; a matchmaking system
                determines a player's skill level and generates a starting rank from which they can climb. There are
                nine tiers; the least skilled are Iron, Bronze, and Silver, and the highest are Master, Grandmaster, and
                Challenger.
            </p>

            <p>
                Two teams of five players compete to destroy the opposing team's "Nexus", which is guarded by the enemy
                champions and defensive structures known as "turrets". Each team's Nexus is located in their base,
                where players start the game and reappear after death. <span>Non-player characters</span> known as
                minions are
                generated from each team's Nexus and advance towards the enemy base along three lanes guarded by
                turrets: top, middle, and bottom. Each team's base contains three "inhibitors", one behind the third
                tower from the center of each lane. Destroying one of the enemy team's inhibitors causes stronger allied
                minions to <span>spawn</span> in that lane, and allows the attacking team to damage the enemy Nexus and
                the two
                turrets guarding it. The regions in between the lanes are collectively known as the "jungle", which
                is inhabited by "monsters" that, like minions, respawn at regular intervals. Like minions, monsters
                provide gold and XP when killed. Another, more powerful class of monster resides within the river
                that separates each team's jungle. These monsters require multiple players to defeat and grant
                special abilities to their slayers' team. For example, teams can gain a powerful allied unit after
                killing the Rift Herald, permanent strength boosts by killing dragons, and stronger, more durable
                minions by killing Baron Nashor.

                Summoner's Rift matches can last from as little as 15 minutes to over an hour. Although the game
                does not enforce where players may go, conventions have arisen over the game's lifetime: typically one
                player goes in the top lane, one in the middle lane, one in the jungle, and two in the bottom
                lane. Players in a lane kill minions to accumulate gold and XP (termed "farming") and try to
                prevent their opponent from doing the same. A fifth champion, known as a "jungler", farms the jungle
                monsters and, when powerful enough, assists their teammates in a lane.

            <p>
                Besides Summoner's Rift, League of Legends has two other permanent game modes. ARAM ("All Random, All
                Mid") is a five-versus-five mode like Summoner's Rift, but on a map called Howling Abyss with only one
                long lane, no jungle area, and with champions randomly chosen for players. Given the small
                size of the map, players must be vigilant in avoiding enemy abilities.

                <span><i>Teamfight Tactics</i></span> is an <span>auto battler</span> released in June 2019 and made a
                permanent game mode the following
                month. As with others in its genre, players build a team and battle to be the last one standing.
                Players do not directly affect combat but position their units on a board for them to fight
                automatically against opponents each round. <i>Teamfight Tactics</i> is available for <span>iOS</span>
                and <span>Android</span> and
                has <span>cross-platform play</span> with the Windows and macOS clients.
            </p>

                Other game modes have been made available temporarily, typically aligning with in-game events.
                Ultra Rapid Fire (URF) mode was available for two weeks as a 2014 <span>April Fools Day</span> prank. In
                the mode,
                champion abilities have no resource cost, significantly reduced cooldown timers, increased movement
                speed, reduced healing, and faster attacks. A year later, in April 2015, Riot disclosed that
                they had not brought the mode back because its unbalanced design resulted in player "burnout". The
                developer also said the costs associated with maintaining and balancing URF were too high. Other
                temporary modes include One for All and Nexus Blitz. One for All has players pick a champion for all
                members of their team to play. In Nexus Blitz, players participate in a series of
                <span>mini-games</span> on
                a compressed map.
